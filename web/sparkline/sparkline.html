<h1> Sparkline embedded word-size charts</h1>
<br>
Did you think I'd forgotten you?<span class='sparkline'></span> Perhaps you'd hoped I had.<span class='sparkline'></span> Don't waste a breath mourning Miss Barnes,
every kitten grows up to be a cat. <span class='sparkline'></span>
They seem so harmless at first; small, quiet, lapping up their saucer of milk.<span class='sparkline'></span>
But once their claws get long enough, they draw blood, sometimes from the hand that feeds them. For those of us climbing to the top fo the food chain,
there can be no mercy. There is but one rule: hunt or be hunted. Welcome back.
